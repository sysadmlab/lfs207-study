# Linux Filesystem Tree Layout </br>  

### '/' - Root Directory  
The top-most level directory under which other directories branch out. As can be seen in the image below - "Storage Editor" Fedora Workstation 44 installation - the **/** directory is one of the **required** directories for a Linux system. </br>  
<img width="1528" height="617" alt="Screenshot From 2026-07-30 23-06-18" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb9b3549-f7d3-46cf-94bd-4c404d90abc7" /> </br>  
Other directories listed under the **/** directory need not be in the same partition as root. For example, in my host system, the directories **/home**, **/isos**, and **/vms** which are sub-directories of the **/** directory, are stored in separate partitions - as shown in the image below: </br>  
<img width="1486" height="865" alt="Screenshot From 2026-07-30 23-24-23" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a48c5ff-9c6c-4933-bcff-9b02a604571e" /> </br>  
The **/** directory must contain all the essential files such as the bootloader, configuration files, and utilities to boot the system and mount other file systems. </br>  


### '/bin' Directory  
The **/bin** directory contains executable programs for both System Administrators and regular non-privileged users. Both in RHEL-based Fedora 9.8 and Debian-based Ubuntu the **/bin** directory is symbolically linked to the **/usr/bin** directory. When we run the command **ls /bin** the command follows the symbolic link to **/usr/bin** and lists the files at that location. There are no sub-directories to the **/bin** directory. </br>

<img width="571" height="119" alt="Screenshot From 2026-07-31 17-25-53" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c59a9691-5753-4bc8-927b-4fd2798cc855" /> </br>  


### '/boot' Directory  
After the Power On Self Test (POST) is complete, the configuration utility (in my case UEFI) looks for the EFI system partition (ESP) which contains the **bootloader**. The bootloader's function is to load two components 1) the Kernel 2) initramfs into memory. These two components the **Kernel**(the file named vmlinuz-5.x.y or vmlinuz-6.x.y) and **initramfs**(initial RAM filesystem) are part of the **/boot** directory. The bootloader is mounted at **/boot/efi** in UEFI-based systems. In addition to these, the **/boot** directory consists of the files **config**, and **System.map**. The RHEL-based Rocky Linux system uses the term **initramfs** whereas the Debian-based Ubuntu Server system names it **initrd**(initial RAM disk). </br>  
<img width="1500" height="403" alt="Screenshot From 2026-07-31 18-44-52" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44bc9eba-121e-4d43-ae41-333fb7edb4a1" />  
<img width="980" height="277" alt="Screenshot From 2026-07-31 18-45-52" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e68c8cd0-1988-4b28-8e99-952013a0c1c6" />  </br>  


### '/dev' Directory
This directory consists of the "device files" also known as "device nodes" that are connected to the system. The CPU, Physical Memory (RAM), Storage devices, Graphics card, Parallel ports - to name a few - are represented as special files in this directory. </br>  
<img width="516" height="455" alt="Screenshot From 2026-07-31 19-19-55" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d86da27f-6550-4deb-b5ce-e036f1d898e6" />  
<img width="594" height="193" alt="Screenshot From 2026-07-31 19-22-55" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/794818af-7613-443a-ac4d-128c137297bf" />  
<img width="666" height="166" alt="Screenshot From 2026-07-31 19-16-43" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d315a553-5f04-49fe-a428-fef5f24018dc" />  
<img width="606" height="152" alt="Screenshot From 2026-07-31 19-27-44" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ac10962-8164-4285-8d33-bd2975fbd4ef" />  
#### Note: The '/dev' directory is the mount point for the 'devtmpfs' pseudo-filesystem - this means that the contents of the '/dev' directory exist only on RAM. </br>  


### '/etc/' Directory  
The '/etc' directory consists of Configuration files and Scripts and **cannot** contain executable files. Some of the files and directories that I have used in this directory are:  
/etc/sudoers.d/  
/etc/default/useradd  
/etc/passwd  
/etc/group  
/etc/shadow  
/etc/nsswitch.conf  
/etc/hosts  
/etc/resolv.conf  
/etc/os-release  
/etc/fstab </br>  


### '/home' Directory  
The **/home** directory is conventionally the place where users' personal data is stored. One exception is that the **root** user has a separate Home Directory which is **/root**. </br>  
<img width="583" height="624" alt="Screenshot From 2026-08-02 18-21-47" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b765b62d-27ac-40b5-b530-59c0594cc96a" /> </br>  
In the Minimal Install version I don't find the directories that are found in the GUI version above. </br>  
<img width="586" height="312" alt="Screenshot From 2026-08-02 18-35-59" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71d7a7a7-5e37-47e9-893b-5ec22857fed0" /> </br>  
In the command prompt, typing **cd** or **cd ~** takes the user to the respective home directory. Typing **echo $HOME** displays the value of the variable - which is the user's home directory: </br>  
<img width="474" height="310" alt="Screenshot From 2026-08-02 18-39-24" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/482d58a0-0f21-4131-aab0-5611ce937425" /> </br>  


### '/lib' and '/lib64' Directories  
These directories contain the shared libraries for the executable programs in **/bin** and **/sbin** and Kernel modules. While **/lib** is 32-bit, **/lib64** contains 64-bit shared libraries.
**/lib** and **/lib64** are symbolically linked to **/usr/lib** and **/usr/lib64**. </br>  
<img width="657" height="142" alt="Screenshot From 2026-08-02 20-24-11" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07d841e4-dd32-4818-9a6e-934c301cb76e" /> </br>  


### '/media' and '/mnt' Directories  
The **/mnt** directory is where a SysAdmin would manually mount a filesystem - a disk or an ISO image or an Network share - for temporary access.  
The **/media** directory is where the system would conventionally **auto-mount** a USB flash drive, a CD/DVD drive, or a SD card. However, currently USB flash drives are mounted to **/run/media/userid/devicelabel**.  
I have tried to connect a USB Flash Drive to two virtual machines - one with a GNOME Graphical Desktop environment and the other which is a minimal install - to check the behaviour.  
The Virtual Machine with the Desktop Environment **auto-mounts** the flash drive at **/run/media/$USER/<device-label>, as shown in the image below: </br>  
<img width="1542" height="357" alt="Screenshot From 2026-08-05 19-45-53" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0eb118e-15b9-4743-9b27-792b1082ff4b" />    
<img width="839" height="311" alt="Screenshot From 2026-08-05 20-08-03" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad967267-058a-454b-99b9-3aa3dcc0c4b4" />    
On further research I understand that a **daemon**("service" in the Windows world") named **udisks2** is responsible for auto-mounting flash drives. This information can be found using the **mount** command and searching for the device's label. This can be seen on the image above.  
Further research about **udisks2** reveals that this daemon may NOT be running in "Minimal Install" instances. Hence to check this, I executed the **systemctl status udisks2** command in the other Virtual Machine. As shown in the image below, the **udisks2** daemon is not running in the Minimal Install Virtual Machine. This means that flash drives will not be auto-mounted in this system. Hence a SysAdmin would have to **manually** mount the drive to the conventional location - which is the **/mnt** directory. </br>  
<img width="866" height="131" alt="Screenshot From 2026-08-05 20-09-12" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4baf810-5f0d-420a-9b06-01b2b5d90a86" />  
Connecting the flash drive to the "Minimal Install" Virtual Machine does nothing. As can be seen in the image below, the device appears in the list of **block devices** but has NOT been mounted. </br>  <img width="1075" height="254" alt="Screenshot From 2026-08-05 20-14-18" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42ee7715-88eb-409e-a289-ccf831f5b163" />  
The simple usage of the **mount** command is: **mount <what-device-to-mount> <where-to-mount-it>**. In my case, I would mount the device **/dev/sdb1** to **/media/myusb/**.    
1. This involves creating a **Mount Point** - the **myusb** directory under **/media** will be the **Mount Point**. Creating the **Mount Point** requires elevated privileges.  
2. The **mount** command also requires elevated privileges.  
The image below shows the operations: </br>  
<img width="1123" height="373" alt="Screenshot From 2026-08-05 20-21-43" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7417f6ff-81f2-4b83-875b-322412cf4aa5" />  
The command to **Unmount** a device is **umount <Mount-Point>**. Hence, executing the command **sudo umount /media/myusb** unmounts the device. Image below: </br>  
<img width="441" height="115" alt="Screenshot From 2026-08-05 20-35-44" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc41f55a-3821-41ce-8d6e-6f7de2a2f415" /> </br>


### '/opt' Directory  
This directory consists of optional and add-on software packages. Software packages that did NOT come with the distribution and those that are NOT part of the system's software manager repositories are stored here. Sub-directories of **/opt** are named after the **vendor** or **package name** and all the files that are required by the software package **MUST** be bundled and stored in the package's directory. For example, my host computer has the Brave Browser and Mega Sync software applications installed; these applications were NOT part of the Linux Distribution and separate software package repositories were added. </br>  
It can seen in the image below that under **/opt** I have two directories each representing the **Vendor/Package Name** and if more than one flavour of the Package from the same Vendor has been installed, then there are sub-directories with distinct Package Names. </br>  
<img width="564" height="295" alt="Screenshot From 2026-08-05 22-57-01" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f95651b-c0f1-4fa6-87a5-e94900849305" /> </br>  


### '/proc' Directory  
The **/proc** directory is a pseudo-filesystem: the contents of this directory are dynamically generated and stored in RAM and not on disk. On a non-running system this directory is empty. Other pseudo-filesystems are **/dev**, **/run**, and **/sys**. In the **/proc** directory, each running process has a directory named after the process' **PID**(Process ID). As shown in the image below, all running processes are listed and each process contains all related information within its directory. </br>  
<img width="1567" height="292" alt="Screenshot From 2026-08-06 19-02-05" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31572c5e-c49e-4105-9ef7-61f0d2cc2c73" />  
<img width="819" height="617" alt="Screenshot From 2026-08-06 18-34-25" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf1330b8-7188-4fd3-9da1-5c378182d7ea" /> </br>  
In addition to the process directories, the **/proc** directory contains important virtual files/directory such as:  
**/proc/cpuinfo**  
**/proc/filesystems**  
**/proc/meminfo**  
**/proc/mounts**  
**/proc/partitions**  
**/proc/sys/** </br>  


### '/sys' Directory  
Just as the '/dev' directory, the **/sys** directory is a pseudo-filesystem and acts as the mount point for **sysfs**. **sysfs** gathers information about the system and presents it in the form of directories and files. </br>  
<img width="562" height="351" alt="Screenshot From 2026-08-06 23-06-35" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45da3cf0-f27e-44a3-b9ac-174621d91efc" />  
Using the command **cat** I can look into the operation state of the Wireless Network Adapter and the Ethernet Adapter in my host computer. </br>  
<img width="553" height="149" alt="Screenshot From 2026-08-06 23-11-48" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8da00cfe-5a89-423d-b2af-427fb3966c17" /> </br>  


### '/sbin' Directory  
The **/sbin** directory consists of essential binaries for administration tasks such as booting, maintenance, and repair. The commands in this directory require elevated privileges for execution. This directory contains commands such as **fdisk**, **fsck**, **ifconfig**, **ip**, **mkfs**, and **user management** to name a few. Similar to the **/bin** directory this directory does **NOT** contain sub-directories. This directory is **Symbolically Linked** to the **/usr/sbin** directory. </br>  
<img width="702" height="529" alt="Screenshot From 2026-08-06 23-52-53" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d750f8f6-7cc8-45b0-a9bf-170f1d3f36e2" />  


### '/tmp' Directory
Although the function of the **/tmp** directory is the same across Linux distributions, the method in which the directory is presented varies significantly between Rocky Linux(Minimal), Ubuntu Server 24.04.4 LTS(Minimal), openSUSE Leap 16(Minimal), and Alma Linux Desktop(GNOME). </br>  
As the name suggests, the purpose of the **/tmp** directory is to provide a temporary space for programs and users to store files.  
It is important to note the permissions for the **/tmp** directory. By exectuing the command **ls -ld /tmp** I note that the directory has a "**Sticky Bit**" set.  
**drwxrwxrwt. 27 root root 580 Aug 18 17:30 /tmp**  
The **Sticky Bit** allows every user to write to the **/tmp** directory, but for a file to be deleted, the user **MUST** be the **Owner** of the file (or) **Root User**. Any user **CANNOT** delete the contents of any other user. </br>  
While openSUSE Leap and Alma Linux mount a RAM-based temporary filesystem **tmpfs** to the mount point **/tmp**, Rocky Linux and Ubuntu treat **/tmp** a part of disk storage. I am aware that the contents of a RAM-based temporary filesystem will vanish the moment the computer is powered off. Further research led me to find that in Rocky Linux and Ubuntu Server, the contents of the **/tmp** directory are cleared after a set number of days. Details can be found in the screenshots below: </br>
